## Simple Content Managment System(CMS) Example

This is a very basic example how you can start to build your own custom Content Managment System (CMS).  
It's not using best methodology for routing and MVC structure but we are separating logical and conditional parts as much as we can.

It's supports multiple theme usage at the same time.  
You can control most of the stuff on your actual webpage using administration panel.  
You can dynamically change your navigation with using drag and drop methods.

And much more...
